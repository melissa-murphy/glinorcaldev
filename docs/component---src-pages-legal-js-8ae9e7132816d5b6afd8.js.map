GLI Norcal Landscape's purpose in collecting non-personally\r\n        identifying information is to better understand how GLI Norcal\r\n        Landscape's visitors use its website. From time to time, GLI Norcal\r\n        Landscape may release non-personally-identifying information in the\r\n        aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its\r\n        website.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        GLI Norcal Landscape also collects potentially personally-identifying\r\n        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users\r\n        and for users leaving comments on https://www.glinorcal.com blog posts.\r\n        GLI Norcal Landscape only discloses logged in user and commenter IP\r\n        addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses\r\n        personally-identifying information as described below.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Certain visitors to GLI Norcal Landscape's websites choose to interact\r\n        with GLI Norcal Landscape in ways that require GLI Norcal Landscape to\r\n        gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of\r\n        information that GLI Norcal Landscape gathers depends on the nature of\r\n        the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at\r\n        https://www.glinorcal.com to provide a username and email address.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>Security</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but\r\n        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of\r\n        electronic storage is 100% secure.
